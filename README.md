# Serpent Strike 

1. Introduction
This project involves the design and implementation of a 2D interactive game using OpenGL, focusing on gameplay mechanics, graphical representation, and real-time user interaction. The game offers a unique twist on traditional snake games, challenging the player to avoid obstacles and earn upgrades to survive for as long as possible.

Gameplay Elements:

Player-Controlled Ball: Drawn using the Midpoint Circle Algorithm, moves via keyboard input to avoid obstacles.
Snakes: Represented as lines drawn using the Midpoint Line Algorithm, spawning randomly from screen edges and moving in straight lines.
Increasing Difficulty: As the player crosses certain point thresholds, the snakes' speed increases to make the game more challenging.
Collision Effects:

The ball grows in size and loses health upon collision with snakes.
Points are awarded for each snake successfully avoided (crossing the screen).
Upgrades and Projectiles:

Points unlock upgrades, enabling the ball to shoot projectiles (small circles) to eliminate snakes for additional points.
Scoring System:

Points are earned by avoiding snakes or hitting them with projectiles.
Score thresholds unlock new abilities for the player and increase the game's difficulty.
